//! I would add an event listener for the onlanguagechange event but

//! IE will report the system's language as the language and not the actual browser language

//! If you want FULL compatibility you should use the "accept/language" header from a request. This will tell you what language any browser is in.

//! You have to relaunch chrome/edge/firefox to actually change the language so there is no point.
